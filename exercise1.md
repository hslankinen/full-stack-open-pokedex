The application will be coded with Python.

Some examples of the Python linters are Black, isort, Flake8, mypy and Pylint. Black’s goal is to make Python code to look the same in every environment, not just to look nice. Isort complements Black by sorting the imports in the alphabetical order. Flake8 adds code style and syntax error checking on top of Black and isort. Mypy complements the picture by adding type checking based on Python type hints (PEP 484). Pylint checks for design issues, naming consistency and code smells.

The Python ecosystem introduces some alternative testing frameworks: Pytest (seen as a simple and fast test framework), Hypothesis (claims to be able to generate and find edge cases humans can’t imagine and narrow down testing to the simplest possible test case causing the failure) , Robot (not just for unit tests but covers acceptance testing, UI automation, and integration testing, as well and claims to offer readable syntax, built-in reporting and to work with works with APIs, browsers, databases, CLI tools).

The Python ecosystem offers several build tools: Poetry (key features: built-in dependency resolution with a lock file; easy virtual environment management;  simplifies publishing packages to PyPI). PDM (Python Dependency Manager) is a package manager that follows PEP 582 and provides a lightweight alternative to Poetry. Hatch is a new build tool focusing on managing Python packages efficiently. It’s known for its flexibility and extensibility. 

Some alternative CI/CD tools besides Jenkins and GitHub actions are: GitLab CI/CD (claims to be more configurable than Jenkins); CircleCI (fast CI/CD pipelines, customizable workflows, first-class Docker support, smart caching, etc.); TravisCI (simple setup, built-in GitHub integration, multiple language support, etc.).

TravisCI can be either self-hosted or cloud-based, wheras GitLab CI/CD and CircleCI are always cloud-based solutions. The simple setup of TravisCI suggests it is a suitable option for small projects but it’s known to slow down under heavy workload in large projects. Self-hosted TravisCI solution may solve the performance issues provided that investments in the CI server are not causing problems. Cloud-based CircleCI and GitLab CI/CD solutions don’t require setting up the CI/CD server and configuring the service is simple in small projects. However, in larger projects the cloud service pricing and special requirements may become an issue.
